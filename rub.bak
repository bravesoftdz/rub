        they are as follows and (i) indicates REMOVAL of a feature from the pipe by the option:

                -h (i) hex encode/decode
                -z (i) compress/deompress using fast entropic method
                -m (i) 4096 bit encrypt/decrypt of stream (encyption of the rubikon still happens even if stream encryption is disabled by -m)
                -s digital signature
                -e encrypt using public keyfile (all public key facilitation needs this option)
                -v digital post signature for vouching of content
                -r (i) the rubikon (do not perform rubikon compression)
                -a pre decrypt voucher authentication
                -d decrypt using your private keyfile (all private key options need this)
                -c check digital signature
        and no other command options are supported. invalid command options displays help, and informs standard error. *)
